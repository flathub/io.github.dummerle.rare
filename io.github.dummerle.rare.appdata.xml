            the Epic Games Launcher.
        </p>
        <p>Why Rare?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tries to be as lightweight as we can make it while still offering a feature-full experience</li>
            <li>Supports all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac)</li>
            <li>Gets out of your way when you don't need it, allowing you to enjoy your games</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Rare supports all core features from the Epic Games Launcher,
            like installing and launching games, also many options to launch
            games with compatibility tools.
